## Notes for reviewers
- Tailwind is included via `src/assets/tailwind.css`. If you want the full Tailwind CLI/postcss integration, run `npm install` and the dev server will process it.
- The `products.json` contains sample data matching the screenshots.
- This scaffold focuses on clarity, small surface area, and easy review.
